# Farmers Market Structure and Planning

This document provides a comprehensive plan for developing a Farmers Market platform. It outlines the core structure, components, and technologies to meet the needs of farmers, buyers, and other stakeholders. The platform is designed for scalability, modularity, and future expansion.

---

## Overview

The Farmers Market platform focuses on connecting farmers and buyers, enhancing efficiency in produce transactions, and providing additional tools for logistics, education, and financial management. This system is divided into three main areas:
1. **Frontend**: User-facing features and dashboards.
2. **Backend**: Data processing, business logic, and integrations.
3. **Core Infrastructure**: Security, databases, and APIs.

## Features

### Frontend
#### Farmer Dashboard
- Manage farmer profiles.
- Upload produce with details (price, quantity, images).
- View real-time market prices and transaction history.

#### Buyer Dashboard
- Search produce by type, location, or price.
- Place bulk orders and track purchase history.

#### Logistics & Delivery
- Book transportation services.
- Track delivery status in real-time.
- Optimize delivery routes.

#### Payments & Financing
- Secure payment gateway integration (e.g., M-Pesa, PayPal, Stripe).
- Loan applications and repayment tracking.

#### Learning Hub
- Access resources like tutorials, videos, and blog posts.
- Use AI for pest and crop diagnosis.
- View training schedules and webinars.

#### Notifications & Alerts
- Receive updates on weather, market trends, and pest outbreaks.

#### Admin Panel
- Manage user accounts and platform content.
- Update market price trends.
- View detailed platform usage statistics.

---

### Backend
#### Core Services
- User authentication and profile management.
- Produce listing, market price updates, and order handling.
- Logistics and delivery tracking.
- Payment processing and loan management.

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Differentiate roles (buyer, seller, admin) during login.
- Route users to respective dashboards based on roles.

#### Learning & Analytics
- AI-powered tools for crop care and pest diagnosis.
- Generate analytics on user engagement and market trends.

#### Admin Tools
- Secure admin access for managing users and platform content.

#### API Design
- RESTful APIs with proper versioning for seamless communication between frontend and backend.
- Endpoints documented using Swagger or Postman.

### Core Infrastructure
- **Databases**:
  - PostgreSQL: Structured data (e.g., users, transactions).
  - MongoDB: Unstructured data (e.g., logs, resources).
- **API Integrations**:
  - Weather, market data, payment gateways, and logistics services.
- **Security**:
  - OAuth2/JWT for secure authentication.
  - SSL/TLS for encrypted data transfers.
  - Firewall and DDoS protection.
- **Caching**:
  - Redis for faster data retrieval in high-demand scenarios.
- **Monitoring**:
  - Tools like Prometheus and Grafana for performance and availability tracking.

---

## Technologies
- **Frontend**: React.js or Next.js for responsive and dynamic interfaces.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express or Django for scalable services.
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL for relational data, MongoDB for flexible storage.
- **Hosting**: AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure for reliability and scalability.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions or Jenkins for streamlined deployment.
- **Version Control**: Git for collaborative development.

## How to Set Up
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/victormmulah/farmer-network.git
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Frontend: `cd frontend && npm install`
   - Backend: `cd backend && npm install`
3. **Environment Setup**:
   - Create `.env` files for backend configurations:
     ```env
     DATABASE_URL=<your_postgres_connection_string>
     JWT_SECRET=<your_secret_key>
     ```
4. **Run the Application**:
   - Backend: `cd backend && npm run start`
   - Frontend: `cd frontend && npm start`
5. **Access the Application**:
   - Visit `http://localhost:3000` for the frontend.
   - API documentation can be accessed at `/api-docs`.

---

## Future Enhancements
- **AI Features**:
  - Crop recommendations based on market trends.
  - Yield prediction models for farming efficiency.
- **Blockchain Integration**:
  - Enhance supply chain transparency with produce traceability.
- **IoT Support**:
  - Integrate field sensors for data on soil and weather conditions.
- **Third-Party API Marketplace**:
  - Expand offerings with integrations for insurance, export services, and more.

---

## Testing
- **Unit Testing**: Jest for backend and React Testing Library for frontend.
- **Integration Testing**: Postman and Cypress for API and UI workflows.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Tools like Selenium for full-system checks.
